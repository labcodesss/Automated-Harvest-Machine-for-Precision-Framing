# Automated-Harvest-Machine-for-Precision-Framing
This project aims to develop an Automated Harvest Machine for precision farming by integrating software and hardware solutions. The software employs image processing and machine learning to identify the ripeness of the crops. Based on this analysis, the hardware system accurately harvests the crop improving efficiency, reducing manual labor.
